Unfortunately, due to limitations of access, awareness, availability, scheduling, and many other reasons, many people who can and should have access to live training events don’t have access. Zúme is an attempt to provide a high-quality entry level substitute for such people. It uses the same principles as many of the live training types available from others. In addition, we find that once a person is trained with Zúme, they can very easily turn around and launch their own group and facilitate training for others using Zúme. This is a powerful opportunity for multiplying disciple-making principles.": "网路训练课程，永远比不上、也无法取代现实生活中的实际训练。然而碍于种种限制﹐诸如欠缺管道﹑了解不周﹑实践门槛高﹑时间有限等﹐许多人虽然需要累积实战经验、进行门徒训练，却始终无法开始。「天国酵母」Zúme 尝试为这群人提供高品质、低门槛的入门训练课程。它的模式跟其他实际训练课程一样，持有相同的原则。我们发现，受过「天国酵母」门徒训练的人﹐不难上手组成属于他们自己的小组﹐并推动其他人也开始使用「天国酵母」教材。这实在是一个推动弟兄姐妹带门徒的好工具。",

We believe every person who fits this profile should take the training.": "这个门徒训练适合给十三岁以上﹐能够阅读的基督门徒。我们认为任何一位合乎这条件的人﹐都最好都有机会学习这个门徒训练课程。希望以后或许会有一种教材提供给无法阅读的人，可惜现在这个版本还不行。",
    "Who owns Zúme?": "「天国酵母」Zúme棣属于什么机构吗？",

It is a coalition of people who have a heart to carry out Christ’s command to make disciples of every people group on earth and expand His Kingdom to every place until His will is done on earth as it is in heaven. The idea for the project originated in a meeting of the Jonathan Project leadership but has since spread far beyond that group. The Jonathan Project is a consortium of people committed to multiplying disciples around the world.": "「天国酵母」这套门徒培训计划（Zúme Project） 不属于任何团体﹐本身也不是一个组织﹐而是由一群有心要行出基督的命令的人组成的﹐要使世上万族万民都成为主的门徒﹐神的国度扩展全地﹐直到祂的旨意行在地上﹐如同行在天上。促成“天国酵母”这套门徒培训计划﹐起先是在关怀普世门徒倍增的「约拿单计划」（ Jonathan Project）一次领袖同工会当中产生的构想﹐但之后的扩展已经远超过那些人所及的范围了。",
    "What are the three phases that are planned?": "这计划分为哪三个阶段？",
    "PHASE 1": "第一阶段",
    "The first phase focuses on the United States and English. The initial goal is to catalyze a training group of four to twelve people per every 5,000 people in the country. Each of these training groups will be challenged to start two first-generation churches which should also reproduce. The target for the United States is to start more than 65,000 English-language Zúme groups and 130,000 churches.": "第一阶段是着重在美国﹐以英语为主。初期目标是在每五千人的人口当中﹐发起一个四至十二人的训练小组﹐每一个训练小组要能够成立两个第一代教会﹐这新一代的教会也要能够倍增。在美国方面的目标﹐是要成立超过六万五千个英语「天国酵母」Zúme小组﹐以及十三万个教会。",
    "PHASE 2": "第二阶段",
    "The second phase focuses on coaching these Phase 1 churches through the reproduction process, as well as delivering the project in other major world languages. The project will start in the following languages: Ahmaric, Arabic, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Burmese, Chinese (Mandarin), Chinese (Cantonese), Farsi, French, German, Gujarati, Hausa, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Maithili, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya, Panjabi (Eastern), Panjabi (Western), Portuguese, Russian, Somali, Spanish, Swahili, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Urdu, Vietnamese, Yoruba.": "第二阶段是着重在以倍增的方式辅导这些第一阶段的教会﹐同时也提供门徒训练课程给世界各地使用主要语系的族群﹐目前的目标语言包括︰华语﹑粤语﹑英语、法语﹑德语﹑义大利语﹑葡萄牙语﹑俄语﹑日语﹑韩语﹑印地语﹑印尼语、泰语﹑越南语﹑缅甸语﹑豪萨语﹑古吉拉特语、阿姆哈拉语﹑阿拉伯语﹑孟加拉语﹑博杰普尔语﹑波斯语﹑卡纳达语﹑迈蒂利语﹑马拉雅拉姆语﹑马拉提语﹑奥利亚语﹑东旁遮普语﹑西旁遮普语﹑索马利亚语﹑西班牙语﹑斯瓦希里语﹑坦米尔语﹑泰卢固语﹑土耳其语﹑乌都语﹑约鲁巴语。",
    "PHASE 3": "第三阶段",
    "The third phase focuses Phase 1 and Phase 2 churches to mobilize globally with a vision to make disciples in every place, among every people group. Zúme Project exists to saturate the globe with multiplying disciples in our generation. To accelerate our mission, we have developed and will deliver a mapping solution allowing teams to work strategically towards the goal of a Zúme training group and two simple churches among every 50,000 people outside the US.": "第三个阶段是着重在动员第一阶段以及第二阶段的教会﹐有全球性的异象，到世界各地方﹑族群中领人做主门徒。「天国酵母门徒训练计划」的成立，目标就在我们这个世代﹐让全世界充满倍增的门徒。为要尽速达成这使命，我们已经做出﹑也将会提供大家一个计划地图给所有的团队。能够有效达成预定的目标﹐就是要在每五万人当中成立一个 「天国酵母」Zúme 门徒训练团体﹐以及两个微型教会。",
    "Why is it called Zúme?": "为什么要取名Zúme「天国酵母」？",
    "Zúme means yeast in Greek. In Matthew 13:33 Jesus is quoted as saying, “The Kingdom of Heaven is like a woman who took yeast and mixed it into a large amount of flour until it was all leavened.” This illustrates how ordinary people, using ordinary resources, can have an extraordinary impact for the Kingdom of God. Zúme aims to equip and empower ordinary believers to reach every neighborhood.": "Zúme是希腊文﹐意思是酵母﹐在马太福音十三章 33 节里﹐耶稣说︰「天国好像面酵﹐有妇人拿来﹐藏在三斗面里﹐直等全团都发起来。」这里比喻天国就像面酵，普普通通的凡夫俗子﹐只用无甚了得普普通通的资源﹐却能为神的国造成无比非凡的影响。这就是「天国酵母」Zúme的目标：装备一般信徒﹐在这个世代成为「天国酵母」﹐让主的门徒生生不息，充满世界，神的国度降临万邦。",
    "What languages will the training be translated into?": "这套门徒训练会翻译成哪些语言？",
    "How are the groups started by trainees aligned or organized?": "接受训练的这些人所成立的小组﹐他们之间要如何彼此合作﹐相互连结来？",
    "It depends. If the trainees come out of a particular church or denomination or network then the most natural thing is for the newly formed groups to be connected with those existing churches, denomination, or network. If desired, however, a new network can be formed from the groups that start. A third alternative would be for the new groups to join with other already existing networks of simple churches. Many of the people involved in developing Zúme come from such networks so we can help arrange that if desired.": "看情况﹐如果受训的门徒原本就是来自同一个教会﹑教派，有自己的关系网络﹐那么最自然的方式就是与自己的教会﹑教派或关系网络相互连结﹔但如有需要﹐也可以从这新开始的小组自行延伸出一个新联络网来。第三个选择，就是将新成立的小组，加进现有的微型教会网络中﹐彼此连结合作。许多参与开发「天国酵母」的人，来自这种的网路，因此如有需要﹐我们也可以帮你安排进适合的网络中。",
    "Who can see my Three-Month Plan?": "哪些人可以看到我的「三个月规划」？",
    "Only you see your plan, unless you link it to your group, then the group leader and coleaders will be able to see your Three-Month Plan. Your plan will also be visible to your coach. If you do not want coaching, go to your profile and set coaching preference to \"Decline Coaching\".": "除非你把个人的「三个月规划」连结到小组里﹐否则只有你能看到﹔小组里也只有带领者以及共同带领者能看到。你的教练也可以看到这个规划表﹐如果你不要教练帮忙﹐你可以进去把个人资料设定为「不需要教练」。",

    "Does Zúme offer a way for me to chat with people in my group?": "「天国酵母」Zúme是否提供我与我们小组员在线上交谈的方式呢？",
    "Not at this time. We recommend that every member of your group create a login and get added to your Zúme group. This way every member will have access to all of the material whenever they want. Then the group can use any messaging platform that they prefer (iMessage, WhatsApp, Facebook group, etc.) for further group communication.": "目前没有提供。我们建议小组的每位成员都注册一个帐号﹐加入所属的「天国酵母」Zúme小组，为的是每位组员能随时登入、读取所有的门徒训练材料。 不过，各个小组若要彼此联系、进行深入对话，仍建议使用其它惯用的通讯软体﹙iMessage、WhatsApp、Line、脸书…...等﹚。",
