    "There’s no one “best way” to tell God’s story (also called The Gospel), because the best way will depend on who you’re sharing with. Every disciple should learn to tell God’s Story in a way that’s true to scripture and connects with the audience they’re sharing with.": "",
    "What comes to mind when you hear God's command to be His \"witness\" and to tell His story?": "",

And, you'll learn another great tool for inviting others into God's family is as simple as telling our story.": "",
    "3-Minute Testimony": "",
    "As followers of Jesus, we are “witnesses\" for Him, because we “testify” about the impact Jesus has had on our lives. Your story of your relationship with God is called your Testimony. It's powerful, and it's something no one can share better than you.": "",

    "Zúme means yeast in Greek. In Matthew 13:33, Jesus is quoted as saying, \"The Kingdom of Heaven is like a woman who took yeast and mixed it into a large amount of flour until it was all leavened.\" This illustrates how ordinary people, using ordinary resources, can have an extraordinary impact for the Kingdom of God. Zúme aims to equip and empower ordinary believers to saturate the globe with multiplying disciples in our generation.": "",

    "How old do you have to be to take the training?": "",
    "We recommend the training for people from 13-years-old and up. If you think you have a child younger than that who can benefit, by all means let them participate.": "",
    "What if someone wants to be trained and doesn’t have an e-mail address?": "",
    "At least one person in the group will have to have an e-mail account they actually use so that they can login and access all of the features of the website. Participants who view the media when present with the group no longer need an email address for the group to begin.": "",
    "How can I preview the lessons before starting a training event?": "",
    "Check out the “Overview” section. It highlights the concepts, the tools, and what your group will practice for each session.": "",
    "What is the content of the training?": "",
    "You can view an overview of the content in the content section, or download the guidebook and review the course content, or login and start a group but at the first page of the session choose \"Exploring Session\". This will let you go through the course content without marking it as completed.": "",
    "I want to make copies of the manual (Guidebook) before the training. How can I do that?": "",
    "You can always find the Guidebook by hovering over the “About” tab on the top of every page.": "",
    "I accidentally hit the next button and I want to go back and view a video again. How do I navigate?": "",
    "Use the \"Previous\" and \"Next\" buttons at the bottom of the session to navigate through the session. From the Dashboard you can click the session number of the group and go directly to that session.": "",
    "There are lots of DMM or CPM trainers, so why is Zúme needed?": "",
    "Live training is better than online training. Online training should never replace live training events. Unfortunately, due to limitations of access, awareness, availability, scheduling, and many other reasons, many people who can and should have access to live training events don’t have access. Zúme is an attempt to provide a high-quality entry level substitute for such people. It uses the same principles as many of the live training types available from others. In addition, we find that once a person is trained with Zúme, they can very easily turn around and launch their own group and facilitate training for others using Zúme. This is a powerful opportunity for multiplying disciple-making principles.": "",
    "What is the statement of faith for Zúme?": "",
    "Since Zúme is not run by an organization, there is not a formal statement of faith. All of us involved, however, would agree on the Lausanne Covenant.": "",
    "Can I do the training by myself?": "",
    "No. There are essential training exercises and practice sessions which require other participants to complete. At least 3-4 people need to be present at every session, or you will not be able to experience the full training.": "",
    "Who is the training appropriate for?": "",
    "The training is appropriate for followers of Christ who are 13-years-old or older and who are able to read. In the future, there may be a version produced that is appropriate for non-literate people, but this is not that version. We believe every person who fits this profile should take the training.": "",
    "Who owns Zúme?": "",
    "There is no organization that is “running” the Zúme Project and the project is not an organization. It is a coalition of people who have a heart to carry out Christ’s command to make disciples of every people group on earth and expand His Kingdom to every place until His will is done on earth as it is in heaven. The idea for the project originated in a meeting of the Jonathan Project leadership but has since spread far beyond that group. The Jonathan Project is a consortium of people committed to multiplying disciples around the world.": "",
    "What are the three phases that are planned?": "",
    "PHASE 1": "",
    "The first phase focuses on the United States and English. The initial goal is to catalyze a training group of four to twelve people per every 5,000 people in the country. Each of these training groups will be challenged to start two first-generation churches which should also reproduce. The target for the United States is to start more than 65,000 English-language Zúme groups and 130,000 churches.": "",
    "PHASE 2": "",
    "The second phase focuses on coaching these Phase 1 churches through the reproduction process, as well as delivering the project in other major world languages. The project will start in the following languages: Amharic, Arabic, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Burmese, Chinese (Mandarin), Chinese (Cantonese), Farsi, French, German, Gujarati, Hausa, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Kurdish, Lao, Maithili, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya, Panjabi (Eastern), Panjabi (Western), Portuguese, Russian, Somali, Spanish, Swahili, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Urdu, Vietnamese, Yoruba.": "",

    "The third phase focuses Phase 1 and Phase 2 churches to mobilize globally with a vision to make disciples in every place, among every people group. Zúme Project exists to saturate the globe with multiplying disciples in our generation. To accelerate our mission, we have developed and will deliver a mapping solution allowing teams to work strategically towards the goal of a Zúme training group and two simple churches among every 50,000 people outside the US.": "",
    "Why is it called Zúme?": "",
    "Zúme means yeast in Greek. In Matthew 13:33 Jesus is quoted as saying, “The Kingdom of Heaven is like a woman who took yeast and mixed it into a large amount of flour until it was all leavened.” This illustrates how ordinary people, using ordinary resources, can have an extraordinary impact for the Kingdom of God. Zúme aims to equip and empower ordinary believers to reach every neighborhood.": "",
    "What languages will the training be translated into?": "",
    "The project will start in the following languages and made available to those wishing to translate the training and tools into additional languages: Amharic, Arabic, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Burmese, Chinese (Mandarin), Chinese (Cantonese), Farsi, French, German, Gujarati, Hausa, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Kurdish, Lao, Maithili, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya, Panjabi (Eastern), Panjabi (Western), Portuguese, Russian, Somali, Spanish, Swahili, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Urdu, Vietnamese, Yoruba.": "",

    "Language Translation Progress.": "",
    "How are the groups started by trainees aligned or organized?": "",
    "It depends. If the trainees come out of a particular church or denomination or network then the most natural thing is for the newly formed groups to be connected with those existing churches, denomination, or network. If desired, however, a new network can be formed from the groups that start. A third alternative would be for the new groups to join with other already existing networks of simple churches. Many of the people involved in developing Zúme come from such networks so we can help arrange that if desired.": "",
    "Who can see my Three-Month Plan?": "",
    "Only you see your plan, unless you link it to your group, then the group leader and coleaders will be able to see your Three-Month Plan. Your plan will also be visible to your coach. If you do not want coaching, go to your profile and set coaching preference to \"Decline Coaching\".": "",
    "Can I print my Three-Month Plan?": "",
    "Yes, make sure you save you plan first, then just scroll to the bottom of your plan and click on the \"Print Saved Plan\" button.": "",
    "Can I edit my Three-Month Plan later?": "",
    "Yes, you can go back to your plan at any time and edit it. Make sure you click, \"Save\" at the bottom of your plan.": "",
    "Does Zúme offer a way for me to chat with people in my group?": "",
    "Not at this time. We recommend that every member of your group create a login and get added to your Zúme group. This way every member will have access to all of the material whenever they want. Then the group can use any messaging platform that they prefer (iMessage, WhatsApp, Facebook group, etc.) for further group communication.": "",
