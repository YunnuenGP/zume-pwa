    "Jesus taught us that we are to stay close — to live as a small, spiritual family, to love and give our lives to one another, to celebrate and suffer — together. However, Jesus also taught us to leave our homes and loved ones behind and be willing to go anywhere — and everywhere — to share and start new spiritual families. So how can we do both? When you're ready, watch the video below and discuss the question that follows.": "耶穌教導我們，我們要維持緊密的關係，如同屬靈小家庭一樣同甘共苦生活，彼此相愛，也為彼此捨命。但是，耶穌也教導我們，我們要離開自己的家以及所愛的人，願意去任何地方，所有的地方，去分享、成立新的屬靈家庭。我們要怎麼兼顧這兩個教導呢？準備好之後，一起來看底下的影片，接著討論更底下所列出的問題。",

    "There are lots of DMM or CPM trainers, so why is Zúme needed?": "已經有很多DMM（門徒訓練）或CPM（植堂訓練）之類門徒訓練了﹐為什麼還需要「天國酵母」Zúme呢？",
    "Live training is better than online training. Online training should never replace live training events. Unfortunately, due to limitations of access, awareness, availability, scheduling, and many other reasons, many people who can and should have access to live training events don’t have access. Zúme is an attempt to provide a high-quality entry level substitute for such people. It uses the same principles as many of the live training types available from others. In addition, we find that once a person is trained with Zúme, they can very easily turn around and launch their own group and facilitate training for others using Zúme. This is a powerful opportunity for multiplying disciple-making principles.": "網路訓練課程，永遠比不上、也無法取代現實生活中的實際訓練。然而礙於種種限制﹐諸如欠缺管道﹑瞭解不周、實踐門檻高、時間有限等，許多人雖然需要累積實戰經驗、進行門徒訓練，卻始終無法開始。「天國酵母」Zúme 嘗試為這群人提供高品質、低門檻的入門訓練課程。它的模式跟其他實際訓練課程一樣，持有相同的原則。我們發現，受過「天國酵母」門徒訓練的人，不難上手組成屬於他們自己的小組，並推動其他人也開始使用「天國酵母」教材。這實在是一個推動弟兄姊妹帶門徒的好工具。",
    "What is the statement of faith for Zúme?": "「天國酵母」Zúme的信仰宣言是什麼？",
    "Since Zúme is not run by an organization, there is not a formal statement of faith. All of us involved, however, would agree on the Lausanne Covenant.": "由於「天國酵母」Zúme不棣屬於任何組織﹐沒有正式的信仰宣言﹐但是我們全體參與人員一致同意《洛桑信約》中的信仰宣言。",
    "Can I do the training by myself?": "我可以只自己一人學習這個門徒訓練嗎？",
    "No. There are essential training exercises and practice sessions which require other participants to complete. At least 3-4 people need to be present at every session, or you will not be able to experience the full training.": "不行。本門徒訓練裡面的主要操練與練習﹐是需要跟其他人一起完成的。每一堂課都要至少三到四人在場才能上課﹐否則無法得到完整的訓練。",
    "Who is the training appropriate for?": "這個門徒訓練適合哪些人？",
    "The training is appropriate for followers of Christ who are 13-years-old or older and who are able to read. In the future, there may be a version produced that is appropriate for non-literate people, but this is not that version. We believe every person who fits this profile should take the training.": "這個門徒訓練適合給十三歲以上，能夠閱讀的基督門徒。我們認為任何一位合乎這條件的人，都最好都有機會學習這個門徒訓練課程。希望以後或許會有一種教材提供給無法閱讀的人，可惜現在這個版本還不行。",
    "Who owns Zúme?": "「天國酵母」Zúme棣屬於什麼機構嗎？",
    "There is no organization that is “running” the Zúme Project and the project is not an organization. It is a coalition of people who have a heart to carry out Christ’s command to make disciples of every people group on earth and expand His Kingdom to every place until His will is done on earth as it is in heaven. The idea for the project originated in a meeting of the Jonathan Project leadership but has since spread far beyond that group. The Jonathan Project is a consortium of people committed to multiplying disciples around the world.": "「天國酵母」這套門徒培訓計畫（Zúme Project） 不屬於任何團體﹐本身也不是一個組織﹐而是由一群有心要行出基督的命令的人組成的﹐要使世上萬族萬民都成為主的門徒﹐神的國度擴展全地﹐直到祂的旨意行在地上﹐如同行在天上。促成「天國酵母」這套門徒培訓計畫﹐起先是在關懷普世門徒倍增的「約拿單計畫」（ Jonathan Project）一次領袖同工會當中產生的構想﹐但之後的擴展已經遠超過那些人所及的範圍了。",
    "What are the three phases that are planned?": "這計劃分為哪三個階段？",
    "PHASE 1": "第一階段",
    "The first phase focuses on the United States and English. The initial goal is to catalyze a training group of four to twelve people per every 5,000 people in the country. Each of these training groups will be challenged to start two first-generation churches which should also reproduce. The target for the United States is to start more than 65,000 English-language Zúme groups and 130,000 churches.": "第一階段是著重在美國﹐以英語為主。初期目標是在每五千人的人口當中﹐發起一個四至十二人的訓練小組﹐每一個訓練小組要能夠成立兩個第一代教會﹐這新一代的教會也要能夠倍增。在美國方面的目標﹐是要成立超過六萬五千個英語「天國酵母」Zúme小組﹐以及十三萬個教會。",
    "PHASE 2": "第二階段",
    "The second phase focuses on coaching these Phase 1 churches through the reproduction process, as well as delivering the project in other major world languages. The project will start in the following languages: Ahmaric, Arabic, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Burmese, Chinese (Mandarin), Chinese (Cantonese), Farsi, French, German, Gujarati, Hausa, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Maithili, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya, Panjabi (Eastern), Panjabi (Western), Portuguese, Russian, Somali, Spanish, Swahili, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Urdu, Vietnamese, Yoruba.": "第二階段是著重在以倍增的方式輔導這些第一階段的教會﹐同時也提供門徒訓練課程給世界各地使用主要語系的族群﹐目前的目標語言包括︰華語﹑粵語﹑英語、法語﹑德語﹑義大利語﹑葡萄牙語﹑俄語﹑日語﹑韓語﹑印地語﹑印尼語、泰語﹑越南語﹑緬甸語﹑豪薩語﹑古吉拉特語、阿姆哈拉語﹑阿拉伯語﹑孟加拉語﹑博傑普爾語﹑波斯語﹑卡納達語﹑邁蒂利語﹑馬拉雅拉姆語﹑馬拉提語﹑奧利亞語﹑東旁遮普語﹑西旁遮普語﹑索馬利亞語﹑西班牙語﹑斯瓦希里語﹑坦米爾語﹑泰盧固語﹑土耳其語﹑烏都語﹑約魯巴語。",
    "PHASE 3": "第三階段",
    "The third phase focuses Phase 1 and Phase 2 churches to mobilize globally with a vision to make disciples in every place, among every people group. Zúme Project exists to saturate the globe with multiplying disciples in our generation. To accelerate our mission, we have developed and will deliver a mapping solution allowing teams to work strategically towards the goal of a Zúme training group and two simple churches among every 50,000 people outside the US.": "第三個階段是著重在動員第一階段以及第二階段的教會，有全球性的異象，到世界各地方、族群中領人做主門徒。「天國酵母門徒訓練計畫」的成立，目標就在我們這個世代，讓全世界充滿倍增的門徒。為要儘速達成這使命，我們已經做出、也將會提供大家一個計劃地圖給所有的團隊。能夠有效達成預定的目標，就是要在每五萬人當中成立一個 「天國酵母」Zúme 門徒訓練團體，以及兩個微型教會。",
    "Why is it called Zúme?": "為什麼要取名Zúme「天國酵母」？",
    "Zúme means yeast in Greek. In Matthew 13:33 Jesus is quoted as saying, “The Kingdom of Heaven is like a woman who took yeast and mixed it into a large amount of flour until it was all leavened.” This illustrates how ordinary people, using ordinary resources, can have an extraordinary impact for the Kingdom of God. Zúme aims to equip and empower ordinary believers to reach every neighborhood.": "Zúme是希臘文﹐意思是酵母﹐在馬太福音十三章 33 節裡﹐耶穌說︰「天國好像麵酵﹐有婦人拿來﹐藏在三斗麵裡﹐直等全團都發起來。」這裡比喻天國就像麵酵，普普通通的凡夫俗子﹐只用無甚了得普普通通的資源﹐卻能為神的國造成無比非凡的影響。這就是「天國酵母」Zúme的目標：裝備一般信徒﹐在這個世代成為「天國酵母」﹐讓主的門徒生生不息，充滿世界，神的國度降臨萬邦。",
    "What languages will the training be translated into?": "這套門徒訓練會翻譯成哪些語言？",
    "How are the groups started by trainees aligned or organized?": "接受訓練的這些人所成立的小組﹐他們之間要如何彼此合作﹐相互連結來？",
    "It depends. If the trainees come out of a particular church or denomination or network then the most natural thing is for the newly formed groups to be connected with those existing churches, denomination, or network. If desired, however, a new network can be formed from the groups that start. A third alternative would be for the new groups to join with other already existing networks of simple churches. Many of the people involved in developing Zúme come from such networks so we can help arrange that if desired.": "看情況，如果受訓的門徒原本就是來自同一個教會、教派，有自己的關係網絡﹐那麼最自然的方式就是與自己的教會、教派或關係網絡相互連結；但如有需要，也可以從這新開始的小組自行延伸出一個新聯絡網來。第三個選擇，就是將新成立的小組，加進現有的微型教會網絡中，彼此連結合作。許多參與開發「天國酵母」的人，來自這種的網路，因此如有需要，我們也可以幫你安排進適合的網絡中。",
    "Who can see my Three-Month Plan?": "哪些人可以看到我的「三個月規劃」？",
    "Only you see your plan, unless you link it to your group, then the group leader and coleaders will be able to see your Three-Month Plan. Your plan will also be visible to your coach. If you do not want coaching, go to your profile and set coaching preference to \"Decline Coaching\".": "除非你把個人的「三個月規劃」連結到小組裡﹐否則只有你能看到﹔小組裡也只有帶領者以及共同帶領者能看到。你的教練也可以看到這個規劃表﹐如果你不要教練幫忙﹐你可以進去把個人資料設定為「不需要教練」。",
    "Can I print my Three-Month Plan?": "可以把我的「三個月規劃」印出來嗎？",
    "Yes, make sure you save you plan first, then just scroll to the bottom of your plan and click on the \"Print Saved Plan\" button.": "可以﹐先確定你已儲存好這規劃表﹐接著拉到最底下點選「列印所存的規劃表」。",
    "Can I edit my Three-Month Plan later?": "我可以更改之前的「三個月規劃」嗎﹖",
    "Yes, you can go back to your plan at any time and edit it. Make sure you click, \"Save\" at the bottom of your plan.": "可以﹐隨時都可以回去更改你的規劃表。一定要記得在更改完之後拉到最底下點選「儲存」以確定完成更改。",
    "Does Zúme offer a way for me to chat with people in my group?": "「天國酵母」Zúme是否提供我與我們小組員在線上交談的方式呢？",
    "Not at this time. We recommend that every member of your group create a login and get added to your Zúme group. This way every member will have access to all of the material whenever they want. Then the group can use any messaging platform that they prefer (iMessage, WhatsApp, Facebook group, etc.) for further group communication.": "目前沒有提供。我們建議小組的每位成員都註冊一個帳號﹐加入所屬的「天國酵母」Zúme小組，為的是每位組員能隨時登入、讀取所有的門徒訓練材料。 不過，各個小組若要彼此聯繫、進行深入對話，仍建議使用其它慣用的通訊軟體﹙iMessage、WhatsApp、Line、臉書…...等﹚。",
